  BubblesNet Controller is the data-storage and user-interface component of the BubblesNet system, a Raspberry Pi 4 based 
  device to store data about the environment inside a cabinet/tent and through commands to the edge-device to turn on and
  off attached relay-controlled environmental control
  devices (heater, humidifier ...) to keep that environment in an ideal state to grow for whatever stage the crop 
  may be at.
