# controller

The controller is a control, and data collection and analysis service designed to 
work with the bubblesnet edge-device.  It consists of:

Client - a React application for controlling one or more edge devices
and viewing the data from those devices.

Server - an API server that serves both the controller React application AND 
the edge devices manipulating the physical environment and queueing data for storage.
