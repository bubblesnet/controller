  ## Introduction

  BubblesNet Controller is the data-storage and user-interface component of the BubblesNet system, a Raspberry Pi 4 based device to store data about the environment inside a cabinet/tent and through commands to the edge-device to turn on and off attached relay-controlled environmental control devices (heater, humidifier ...) to keep that environment in an ideal state to grow for whatever stage the crop may be at.

  - Latest PR fixes an issue with public fleets.

  - Requires at least 4G RAM, preferably 8G. Developed and tested on 8G, known not to work on 1G. RAM requirement driven almost entirely by ActiveMQ.

  - This is literally an alpha-release. The underlying code has been in production for months, but the deployment to a Balena public fleet is brand new and has required a number of modifications. 


  THIS FLEET IS NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME YET. ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT IS MATURE AND HAS ITERATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF CROPS, I STILL HAVE TO DEBUG A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE 
  UNIQUE TO BALENA PUBLIC FLEETS. THIS REQUIRES ME TO TURN PUBLIC VISIBILITY ON AND OFF FAIRLY FREQUENTLY. PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS FLEET UNTIL THIS MESSAGE IS GONE.
